# vue-blog

This project is called "Pizza Blog". Even though there is a "pizza" called out in the title, it is not going to be about the pizza related stuff only. I like to cook and bake, so I'm going to post the recipes in here which I will find interesting.

I use Vue 2 with Vue-router and Pinia to build the front-end. The backend part is based on the Firestore.
