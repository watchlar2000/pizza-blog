      title: "Making Naturally Leavened Pizza Dough",
      description: [
        "We all know you can buy pre-made pizza dough and make a lack luster pizza crust. It is time to level up your pizza game and make your own dough using your own starter. We have detailed instructions on how to go from a novice dough maker to a world class pizza expert. Grab your Pizzacraft® gear and let's get to work on a masterpiece!",
        "We have a recipe about how to make your own starter and recipes on how to make your own pizza dough, but we forgot to show you how to use your starter in your recipe. Using a starter in you dough can add a lot of character and flavor to your pizza that you can’t get from commercial yeast.",
        "This recipe was developed to add flavor to the crust without turning it into a sourdough pizza crust. To do this we don’t add a ton of starter and let that starter slowly work its magic. The process is longer than your average dough recipe, but I think once you give it a try you will have a hard time going back to using store bought yeast.",

      title: "Cherry Tomato and Basil Flatbread",
      description: [
        "Fall is definitely here, but at Pizzacraft®, we’re trying to hold on to that summer feeling as long as possible. This Cherry Tomato and Basil Flatbread recipe is a taste of summer that will remind you how versatile pizza toppings can be. The combination of the fresh crisp salad and the warm flatbread make for a perfectly complex bite. We heated up our Baking Steel and got to business on this new summer (or fall) favorite. So hit the grocery store and find some of the final fresh tomatoes and basil of the season and get to work on this warm summer delight.",
        "We combine olive oil and sliced garlic to make a zesty infused oil that adds heaps of flavor to the salad as well as the flatbread. The flatbread is hearty enough to eat solo for a light meal. It is also a great way to give your menu a twist when making a bunch of traditional-style pizzas on pizza night.",
        "This flatbread recipe is so quick and easy to make, it’s our go-to choice for a healthy weeknight meal. Our  Baking Steel is one of our favorite methods for making a pizza on the grill. Baking Steels conduct heat better than a pizza stone, store more heat per unit volume, and stabilize at a lower temperature.",

      title: "Green Garlic Cream Pizza Sauce",
      description: [
        "The internet is full of crazy allegations and outlandish theories. From claiming the world is flat to Justin Bieber being a space lizard. As much as I wish the latter was true its most likely not and some theories on the internet just need to die.  So today I will do my part to clean the internet of false claims. Since I’m still not sure about Justin Bieber’s origins I’ll tackle the LIES of white pizza sauce.",
        "All you have to do is a simple google search for white pizza sauce and you will be bombarded with recipes that start by saying, “add flour and butter to a pan to make a roux. Slowly whisk in milk and cook until thickened.”  Enough is enough! Besides the fact that these sauces make for a pizza that is heavy and dense, it’s also way more work then you need to do.",
        "The most amount of work you should be putting in is heating up a pot of cream with aromatics and the least should be opening up a carton of cream and using it. White pizzas should be more about the cheese then the sauce. By using cream we are just creating an opportunity for the cheese to melt evenly and become slightly saucy.  Although this sauce is simple there are a couple of ways to go about making it.",

      title: "Bar Style Pizza Recipe",
      description: [
        "I try to never ask because it inevitably ends in an argument. No, I’m not talking about politics, I’m talking about pizza. Whether you are asking about the best pizza joint in town or the best style of pizza you are sure to hear a lot of opinions that are presented as matter of fact. There’s, of course, Neapolitan, New York, Chicago, and Detroit pies just to name a few. Then there is the side that says deep dish pizza isn’t truly a pizza. I’m not saying I agree so all you Chicagoans don’t go flooding the comments below.",
        "I don’t want to make the debate any harder than it already is but I do think that Bar Pizza need a little bit of the spotlight too. Bar pizza also known as tavern pizzas are popular in New England. Two of the more notable establishments would be Star Tavern in New Jersey and Lynwood Café in Massachusetts.  You might be thinking “what’s so special about pizza served in a bar? I have been to plenty of pizza spots and had a drink with my slice.”  The pizza has a few unique properties. It is rolled out very thin and sauced all the way to the edge of the dough. The pizza is also cooked in an oiled pan.",
        "It’s thought that owners of bars wanted to offer some food to keep patrons in their seats instead of going somewhere else for food. The thin cracker-like crust is believed to have come about because owners wanted to make sure you don’t fill up too much leaving plenty of room for more beverages.  As anyone who has worked in the restaurant industry can tell you, beverages are where you make most of your money.",
